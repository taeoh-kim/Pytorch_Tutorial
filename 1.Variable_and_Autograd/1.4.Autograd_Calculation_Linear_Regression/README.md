Default Mode is GPU Mode. If not, remove all GPU functions (ex. .cuda() or .cpu())

In this tutorial,

Our example is Linear Regression.

This code contains overall process of Machine Learning.

- Define Data
- Define Model
- How to Get Parameters in Network
- Define Optimizer
- Training Loop
- Define Loss
- Forward and Backward Propagation
- Optimizer Run
- Print Log
- And. Finally. Test Current Model

And also, you will learn .zero_grad() and .backward() function's role in Pytorch using Data and Gradient Printing.
